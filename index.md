# Luqman Ali

Data Management & AI Leader | SAP Asia | Singapore

## About Me

I'm a technology leader with 15+ years of experience driving enterprise data transformation across the Asia-Pacific region. Currently serving as Data Management Lead at SAP Asia, I combine deep expertise in enterprise data governance with emerging capabilities in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

My career has focused on helping organisations across diverse industries—from global banks to agribusiness—design and implement robust data management solutions that deliver measurable business impact. I've built and led regional teams, scaled consulting practices from the ground up, and served as a trusted advisor to C-level executives on data strategy and transformation.

Recently, I've been channelling my passion for emerging technology into artificial intelligence, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Nanyang Technological University (expected 2026). This academic pursuit complements my professional work, where I'm actively implementing AI/ML solutions including RAG systems, LLM-powered tools, and predictive models to enhance how we deliver consulting services.

## What You'll Find Here

This site showcases the breadth of my professional and academic work:

### [SAP Data Management Projects](sap-projects)
A collection of enterprise implementations spanning data governance, master data management, and transformation programmes across Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Japan, and the Philippines. These projects demonstrate hands-on delivery leadership, solution architecture, and advisory work with global organisations.

### [AI & Machine Learning Projects](ai-projects)
Recent work applying artificial intelligence to practical challenges, including RAG system evaluation frameworks, pathogen tracking for food safety (Singapore Food Agency collaboration), computer vision applications, and ML-powered consulting tools. These projects reflect my developing expertise in LLMs, prompt engineering, and AI system design.

## Current Focus

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of enterprise data management and artificial intelligence—exploring how AI can transform how organisations govern, manage, and derive value from their data assets. My Master's project with the Singapore Food Agency exemplifies this, applying LLMs and prompt optimisation to automate critical food safety monitoring processes.
